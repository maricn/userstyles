# maricn's custom user(styles|scripts)

## For

For nocturnal spirits mostly. Not intended to make you happy. It works on my machine. Or it doesn't. Most often it doesn't.

## Why

* I like black.
* I use keyboard a lot. Browsing with [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl).
* I like when my screen can host all the relevant information. #nowaste

## How

* Userstyles are in [css](https://github.com/maricn/userstyles/tree/main/css) folder. I recommend using [Stylus addon](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases).
* Userscripts are in [js](https://github.com/maricn/userstyles/tree/main/js) folder. I recommend using [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey)

_Don't laugh at my code. I warned you!_

### Tips

Stylus extension now offers possibility of (1) marking certain userstyles as "night mode only" and (2) applying appropriate night or daytime userstyles according to the system settings (toggle night mode in system appearance settings). This allows automated application of dark mode userstyles.
