# maricn's custom user(styles|scripts)

## For

For nocturnal spirits mostly. Not intended to make you happy. It works on my machine. Or it doesn't. Most often it doesn't.

## Why

* I like black.
* I use keyboard a lot. Browsing with [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl).
* I like when my screen can host all the relevant information. #nowaste

## How

* Userstyles are in [css](https://github.com/maricn/userstyles/tree/main/css) folder. I recommend using [Stylus addon](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases).
* Userscripts are in [js](https://github.com/maricn/userstyles/tree/main/js) folder. I recommend using [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey)

_Don't laugh at my code. I warned you!_

## Principles

* Dark > Light
* Keyboard > Mouse
* Compact > Comfortable
* Works > Pretty

Not encouraged. Your use case is probably different from mine. OK, if you really want to, you can make a PR.
